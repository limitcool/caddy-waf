Okay, this is a great improvement!  Here's how we can split this into a `README.md` with a good overview and a `/docs/` folder for more in-depth documentation. I'll also suggest some minor tweaks.

**1. `README.md` (Root of the Repository)**

This will be your project's landing page. Keep it concise and focused on the essentials:

# 🛡️ Caddy WAF Middleware

A robust, highly customizable, and feature-rich **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** middleware for the Caddy web server. This middleware provides **advanced protection** against a comprehensive range of web-based threats, seamlessly integrating with Caddy and offering flexible configuration options to secure your applications effectively.

## 🛡️ Core Protections

*   **Regex-Based Filtering:** Deep URL, data & header inspection using powerful regex rules.
*   **Blacklisting:** Blocks malicious IPs, domains & optionally TOR exit nodes.
*   **Geo-Blocking:** Restricts access by country using GeoIP.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse via customizable IP request limits.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Dynamically blocks requests based on cumulative rule matches.
*   **Multi-Phase Inspection:** Analyzes traffic throughout the request lifecycle.
*   **Sensitive Data Redaction:** Removes private info from logs.
*   **Custom Response Handling:** Tailored responses for blocked requests.
*   **Detailed Monitoring:** JSON endpoint for performance tracking & analysis.
*   **Dynamic Config Reloads:** Seamless updates without restarts.
*   **File Watchers:** Automatic reloads on rule/blacklist changes.

## 🛠️ Basic Configuration

Here's a minimal Caddyfile example to get started:

```caddyfile
{
    auto_https off
    admin localhost:2019
}

:8080 {
    log {
        output stdout
        format console
        level INFO
    }

    handle {
        header -Server
    }

    route {
        # WAF Plugin runs on all requests first
        waf {
            metrics_endpoint /waf_metrics
            rule_file rules.json
            ip_blacklist_file ip_blacklist.txt
            dns_blacklist_file dns_blacklist.txt
        }

        # Match the waf metrics endpoint specifically and stop processing
        @wafmetrics path /waf_metrics
        handle @wafmetrics {
            # Do not respond here so it goes to the WAF plugin
        }

        # All other requests, respond with "Hello World"
        handle {
            respond "Hello world!" 200
        }
    }
}
```
